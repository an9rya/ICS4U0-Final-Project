Perfect Parenting

Instructions

Game
Our game is designed to teach children all about poor parenting and recognize the signs of a bad parent. There will also be scenarios where the user must answer questions based on the material taught in the first level. Through level 1 and 2, there will be a small character named The Blob, which will take the user along its journey. Level 1 will teach the user about poor parenting, level 2 will include yes or no questions for practice, and level 3 will be an escape room where the user must score at least 80% in order to escape. Please note that if the user's parental figure shows some of the signs, it may not necessarily mean that they are a poor parent.

Level 1
In some of the background pictures, there will be square buttons. Some of these buttons redirect to a screen that provides information. Buttons should be clicked. Other squares will reveal a hidden blob when clicked that gives the information. The user has to follow the blob along its journey to teach them all about parenting as well as provide support if needed. All buttons must be pressed in order to complete the level. On screens 2 and 10 (screens with multiple square buttons), a button will appear green after clicked, and all buttons need to be clicked to continue. Some buttons will be harder to find than others. 

Level 2
The blob will give the user specific scenarios (questions) where they must determine whether or not it is considered poor parenting. The buttons yes/no should be pressed to answer the prompt. The blob will tell the user if they are correct or incorrect, as well as the reasoning. There will be no score in this level. 

Level 3
Given specific scenarios, there will be 3 answers to choose from. The user must determine which option is the best fit for each scenario. The user must score at least 8 out of 10 in order to escape. The correct answer, as well as the score, will not be shown, but the user will know if they passed or failed. If the user has failed, they have the option to retry the level or to skip it and continue the game.
